** What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? **

I had some difficulty with the syntax of local Git pulls and pushes.

** What concepts were clarified during the GPS? **

I feel like I have a much better understanding of both Git and GitHub workflow now. Verbalizing each step of the process, and seeing the results of mistakes we made and figuring out how to correct them together, really helped me understand the importance of good workflow and how easy it is to overlook.

** What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? **

I feel like I'm forgetting a lot, but here are some of the ones that I remember:

* Early on, I asked Amanda and Dana about the the meaning of the terms in the command `git pull/push origin master` and how we use them, depending on what we want to accomplish.
* Why you would want ever want to pull a feature branch instead of the master from GitHub.
* Why you would use `git fetch` and `git merge` instead of `git pull`.
* What "inline" meant and how to put a picture inside of a markdown file.

** What still confuses you about Git? **

I think all of my specific confusions have been resolved for now. I still need practice with Git workflow, and making sure my code is as efficient and clear as possible.

** How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? **

My first experience was great! Amanda was really fun and pleasant to work with, and we communicated well about both the technical aspects of the challenge and how we were doing personally throughout the session. Dana was a really helpful presence during our hour with her, and I thought she did a great job of offering assistance/tips when we needed her without making us feel like we didn't know what we were doing.
